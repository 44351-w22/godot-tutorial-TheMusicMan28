I followed this tutorial (https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/getting_started/first_2d_game/index.html#prerequisites) and added some of my own modifications. Those changes include:

  1: Made it so that enemy eyes change between Red and Blue
  2: Allow the user to use WASD as input as well as arrow keys
  3: Added animated Spiral for background (PLEASE DO NOT MAKE YOURSELF SICK)
  4: Allow the player to have 3 lives
  5: Play Wilhelm Scream on hit.
  6: Remove all enemies when hit
  7: Keep track of High Score (during playtime)
  
 Have fun!!!
